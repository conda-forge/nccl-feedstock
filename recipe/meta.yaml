  summary: Optimized primitives for collective multi-GPU communication

  description: |
    The NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) implements multi-GPU
    and multi-node collective communication primitives that are performance
    optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. NCCL provides routines such as all-gather,
    all-reduce, broadcast, reduce, reduce-scatter, that are optimized to
    achieve high bandwidth over PCIe and NVLink high-speed interconnect.
